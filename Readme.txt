The program will generate the picture of stars from May 2023 to May 2024. 

For task 3.1.1, 3.1.2, and 3.1.5 can take a bit longer to execute since the program build on iteration.

For task 3.1.2, run this task only 1 unless you have deleted all the image_<date_format>_star_<num>.txt. Because if you re-execute in task, the first line (count the total number of stars) will be duplicated and appeared twice instead 1. 

Task 3.1.3 cannot set the default filename to execute  by going through all the text files created in 3.1.2 as default.

Task 3.1.4 cannot highlight the frame by making the surrounded pixel being dimmish.
